      To submit patches to libvirt-cim, you must follow the DCO process, 
      outlined below:

    <h3>Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1</h3>
    <p>
      By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the 
          right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the 
          file; or
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my 
          knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I 
          have the right under that license to submit that work with 
          modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the 
          same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a 
          different license), as indicated in the file; or
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who 
          certified (1), (2) or (3) and I have not modified it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are 
          public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal 
          information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained 
          indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or 
          the open source license(s) involved.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      then you just add a line saying
    </p>

    <p>
      using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

    <h3>Guidelines for Submitting Patches.</h3><p>
      Patches should be submitted using Mercurial's patchbomb extension,  and we 
      recommend using the queues extension as well.  On top of that, we have some 
      guidelines you should follow when submitting patches.  This makes reviewing 
      patches easier, which in turns improves the chances of your patch being 
      accepted in a timely fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For help on how to use the patchbomb extension, see 
      <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch14.html">Section 14.4</a> of 
      <i>Distributed revision control with Mercurial</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For help on the queues extension, see 
      <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html">Chapter 12</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Single Patches:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          When you add a patch to the queue you have an idea of where
          you're going with it, and the commit message should reflect
          that.  Be specific.  Avoid just saying something like,
          "Various fixes to AllocationCapabilities."  Add a list of
          what was actually fixed, like, "Add EnumInstanceNames
          support," and, "Eliminate duplicate instances."
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first line of your commit message will be the subject of
          the patch email when you send it out, so write it like a
          subject.  Keep it short and to the point, then start a new
          line and feel free to be as verbose as you need to be.  The
          entire commit message will be included in the patch.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Stay on task with a patch.  If you notice other problems
          while you are working on a patch, and they are not most
          definitely specific to your patch, they should be another
          patch.  The same goes for nitpicking.  While it might be
          only a line or two here and there that is off track, this is
          actually one of the easiest ways to make a patch difficult
          to review.  All the trivial changes hide what is really
          going on.  Make the unrelated changes a new patch or don't
          make them at all.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your patch addresses a strange issue or a rare edge case
          that the reviewers are unlikely to be familiar with, make
          sure the commit message include some example testcase with
          results, so the reviewers can verify your patch more
          quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before you email, export.  If you have a patch called
          "alloc_fixes", which would be emailed with "hg email
          alloc_fixes", you should first run "hg export alloc_fixes".
          This lets you review your patch.  Does it have any typos in
          the comments?  Did you accidentally include an irrelevant
          change?  Is your commit message still accurate and useful?
          This is the single biggest step in ensuring you have a good
          patch.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your patch needs to be reworked and resent, prepend a
          "version number" to the first line of the commit message.
          For example, "Add EnumInstance to RASD," becomes "#2 Add
          EnumInstance to RASD."  This helps mail readers thread
          discussions correctly and helps maintainers know they are
          applying the right version of your patch.  At the end of the
          commit message, explain what is different from one version
          to the next.  Nobody likes having to diff a diff.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If your patch depends on a patch that exists on the mailing
          list but not in the tree, it is okay to send your patch to
          the list as long as your commit message mentions the
          dependency.  It is also a good idea to import the patch into
          your tree before you make your patch.  For example, a new
          patch called "cu_statusf API change" is on the list, and
          your patch needs the new API.  Save the email (no need to
          trim headers) as api_change.eml, then do "hg qimport
          api_change.eml" and "hg qpush" so that the patch is applied
          to your tree.  Now write your patch on top of it.  You
          should still indicate the dependency in your commit message.
      </p></li>
    </ol><h4>Patchsets:</h4><ol><li>
        <p>
          When you send a group of patches, Mercurial's email
          extension will create a "header" email.  Make the subject
          and body of that email meaningful, so we know how the
          patches relate.  It's easy to say, "Each patch has a commit
          message, it's obvious how they work together," but the rest
          of the list usually won't agree with that.  If the commit
          messages for each patch are good, you shouldn't need more
          than a sentence or two to tie them all together, but you do
          need it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If any of your patches are rejected and you rework them,
          resend the entire set.  This prevents things like, "So use
          patch 1 of 4 from the set I sent yesterday, 2 and 3 of 4
          from the patch I sent an hour later, and patch 4 of 4 from
          today."
        </p>
      </li> 
      <li>
        <p>
          If you resend a patchset, apply part (6) of the Single
          Patches guidelines to your "Patch [0 of 3]" header email,
          for all the same reasons.
        </p>
